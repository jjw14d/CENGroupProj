This program relies on the SDL2 and SDL2 image_libraries.
For Advanced Packaging Tool users, use the commands:

apt-get install libsdl2-dev

apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev 

for Homebrew users, install formulas are:

brew install sdl2

brew install sdl2_image

After installing necessary packages, simply run make. The 
program compiles to a.out.


====================================================================


For Windows installation, using Microsoft Visual Studio:

Download the SDL2 headers and binaries from the SDL website,
libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

Under Development Libraries, you'll find a link to the .zip file labeled
for Visual C++

Open Visual Studio and start a new, empty project.
Click Project->Properties, then under Configuration Properties click
VC++ Directories. In the Include Directories field, select edit.
Add the include folder, located amongst the SDL2 files you just
downloaded and unzipped. This allows Visual Studio acces to the SDL2
header files.

Next, in Configuration Properties->VC++ Directories, select Library Directories
and, like the previous step, select edit and add the lib folder. Inside
of lib there are two folders, x64 and x86. Add the x86 folder, regardless of
the architecture of your OS.

Next, still in Configuration Properties, select Linker->Input, and under 
Additional Dependencies, select edit. In the available field, type

SDL2.lib;
SDL2main.lib;

and click OK.

Then, still in Configuration Properties, select Linker->System, and under
SubSystem, select Console.

Lastly, find the SDL2.dll file within the lib folder previously extracted,
and copy it into either your projects working directory, or your system 
directory (C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 for x86, C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for x64)
